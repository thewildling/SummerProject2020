During 4 weeks of summer 2020 I have been working on building an Operator Simulation game. 
The game is a simplified representation of how an operator in the metal industry works to secure correct kA on electrodes in a metal-melting-furnace to produce a desired amount om MW. 
The project is created in Visual Studio Code, with JavaScript, CSS and HTML-code.

# Operator Simulator Game #

During 2 weeks of summer 2020 I have been working on building an Operator Simulation game. 
The game is a simplified representation of how an operator in the metal industry works to secure correct current (kA) on electrodes in a metal-melting-furnace to produce a desired amount of power (MW). 
The project is created in Visual Studio Code, with C#, JavaScript, CSS and HTML-code. It is also connected to a database hosted on MySQL (by use of the free web hosting provider InfinityFree). The project was deployed to a website for which the game can be played. The website can be found here: http://operatorgame.epizy.com/.

## Setup ##

In my web hosting provider I created a website-address and added a MySQL-database (for the highscore-list). All the codes from the OperatorSimulationGame-folder was added to InfinityFree and the website is deployed from there. 

## Reuirements ##

- Visual Studio or another editor where one can write HTML, CSS, Javascript and C#
- A web hosting provider (I used Inifinity Free)
